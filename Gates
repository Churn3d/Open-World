Gates connect all the universes in the multiverse. Universes are also named by there gate.

Tech talk:
  A universe is any span of space where the laws of physics are the solid throughout. Because the laws of physics vary from gate to gate complected structures like humans and computers would fall apart, explode, or deteriorate in some painful fashion if introduced into a gate besides there own. Gates transcribe objects from one gate to the next with little side affects. 

Bare bones:
  Allows travel between universes. 

Origin: 
  Seekers invented the first ones. Most are controlled by the Protectors.

Use:
  Find gate with correct address, place palm on the gate, command it to open.

Fluff:
  "Gates require manna to fully transcribe any object that passes through it, so most gates have a lock on them that becomes unlocked when a safe amount is near," taping the lock, "But I have found that there definition of a safe amount is much different then mine." Producing a metallic hammer and chisel.
