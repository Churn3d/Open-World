Manna is the underlying magic system of the multiverse.

Tech talk:
  It is a property of mater that is affected by sentience. The more of it in a system there is the more likely unlikely things that benefit sentience within a system will occur. 

Bare bones:
  Manna influences probability. If you have a lot you are lucky. If you have a ton you are magical. If you have none you are dead.

Origin:
  Manna is produced by patterns e.g. crystals, rituals, and life itself.

Use:
  Anything you can rationalize. 

Fluff:
  "You see, the probability of a jar of sweet-tee spontaneously appearing in my hand is so infinitesimally low it should be considered impossible." Pausing for a sip, "now, where where we?"
